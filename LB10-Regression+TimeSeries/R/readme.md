Any data recorded with some fixed interval of time is called as **time series data**. This fixed interval can be hourly, daily, monthly or yearly. e.g. hourly temp reading, daily changing fuel prices, monthly electricity bill, annul company profit report etc. In time series data, time will always be an *independent variable* and there can be one or many *dependent variable*.

**Time series forecasting** is the process of analyzing time series data using statistics and modeling to make predictions and inform strategic decision-making.  
It’s not always an exact prediction, and likelihood of forecasts can vary wildly—especially when dealing with the commonly fluctuating variables in time series data as well as factors outside our control.


### R/RStudio Examples for Regression + Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

* The analysis and prediction of  the relationship between 'TV advertising' and 'sales' using a simple [Linear Regression model](https://github.com/sawubona-gmbh/BINA-FS23-WORK/blob/2169897e52586ca9a08a78cf0fb4454b1faed2c5/LB10-Regression+TimeSeries/R/R-CODE_linear-nonlinear_REGRESSION_v2.R)

* The [ARIMA based analysis and forecast](https://github.com/sawubona-gmbh/BINA-FS23-WORK/blob/2169897e52586ca9a08a78cf0fb4454b1faed2c5/LB10-Regression+TimeSeries/R/R-Code_TIMESERIES_v5.R) for the Air Passengers dataset
